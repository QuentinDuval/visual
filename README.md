# Goal

The goal behind this project is to experiment with some visual display of drawings, and the possiblity to combine several drawing into more complex ones using higher order functions (as done in SICP).

Secondary goals are to find out if it is possible to build a small DSL on top of this, to offer some kind of fun and easy to understand basic introduction to programming.
